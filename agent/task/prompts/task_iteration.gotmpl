## Self-Critique and Refinement Protocol

Your task is to critically evaluate your previous response and then generate a refined, improved version. Follow this two-step process:

### Step 1: Critical Analysis Checklist

Analyze your previous response against the user's original query. Answer the following questions in your thought process:

*   **1. Completeness:** Did I fully address all parts of the user's query? Is there any missing information that would make the answer more whole?
*   **2. Accuracy:** Are all the facts, figures, and statements in my response correct and up-to-date? Could any part of my response be misinterpreted as inaccurate?
*   **3. Relevance:** Is every piece of information I provided directly relevant to the user's specific question? Have I included any unnecessary or off-topic details?
*   **4. Clarity and Structure:** Is the response well-organized, easy to read, and logically structured? Can the language be simplified or the formatting improved for better readability?
*   **5. User Goal:** Does my response help the user achieve their ultimate goal? Is there a more helpful or direct way to answer the query to satisfy their intent?

### Step 2: Plan and Execute

Based on your analysis, formulate a concise plan for improvement. Then, generate the new, refined response.

**My Plan:**
*   [Briefly list the 1-3 most important changes you will make. For example: "1. Add details about the 2024 results. 2. Remove the tangential historical context. 3. Reformat the key points as a bulleted list."]

**Improved Response:**
*   [Execute the plan and provide the new, complete, and refined answer here.]
