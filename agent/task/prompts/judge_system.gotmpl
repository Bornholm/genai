2. Check if the response provides sufficient information to satisfy the query
3. Verify that the response stays on topic and doesn't include irrelevant content
4. Ensure the response answers what was actually asked, not a related but different question
5. Assess the capacity of the agent to complete the given task by judging its response regarding its capabilities.

## Input Format:

**Instructions:** [The user's additional instructions]
